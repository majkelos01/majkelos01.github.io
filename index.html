Setting Up ArchLinux Segate GoFlex Home 

1. Go to Ubuntu and connect the HDD 
1.1 Partition the disk to have 2 or 3 partitions

/sbin/fdisk /dev/sdb (or sda depends)

At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:

    Type o. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
    Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
    Now type n, then p for primary, 1 for the first partition on the drive, and then press ENTER, to accept the default value for the beginning of the partition and +20G for the next prompt.
    Create a partition for the remainder of the drive. Type n, then p for primary, 2 for the second partition on the drive, and then press ENTER to accept the rest of the default values.
    Exit by typing w.
    
2. Create the ext3 filesystem:

cd /tmp
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/pogoplug/mke2fs
chmod +x mke2fs
./mke2fs -j /dev/sdb1
mkdir alarm
mount /dev/sdb1 alarm

3. Download and install Arch Linux ARM:

cd alarm
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/pogoplug/bsdtar
chmod +x bsdtar
wget http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-kirkwood-latest.tar.gz
./bsdtar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-kirkwood-latest.tar.gz
cd ..
umount alarm

4. Create ext filesystem 

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2

5. Connect the disk to the Dock and should be working (this works cos I have uBoot already isntaled and configured)

pacman -S screen
some notes on screen stuffs:
Type “Ctrl-A” and ?  without " to see the commands

  __Detach the screen___
  The download process is estimated to take 2 hours long. 
  If you disconnect the SSH session, or suddenly the connection lost by accident, 
  then the download process will stop. You have to start from the beginning again. 
  To avoid that, we can use screen and detach it
  
  screen
  ....command that takes time.....
  .....While downloading in progress, you can press “Ctrl-A” and “d“.
  
  ___Re-attach the screen_____
  screen -r
  if mroe thn 1 screens than
  screen -ls
    - this will output lists with numbers
      screen -r 7849
      
     
  ____Leaving Screen_____
   “Ctrl-A” and “d”
   Ctrl-A” and “K”
